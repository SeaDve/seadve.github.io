New users might be overwhelmed with the hundreds of distros to choose from compared to Windows with just a few versions to choose from. I cannot really tell you which is the best for you as we come with different needs and motives, but here is a list of Linux distros that will help you determine what could be the best for you.\n\nNote that this list may vary from user to user. The main criteria I use are ease of use, user experience, and software and hardware support.\n\n5. Linux Mint\n\nPros\n\nVery lightweight and snappy\nGreat experience for former Windows users\nGreat for older laptops\n\nCons\n\nThe desktop looks dated\n\nLinux Mint is an Ubuntu-based distro. It comes with the Cinnamon DE environment by default which is noticeably lighter compared to GNOME. But if you do not like Cinnamon, you can choose between XFCE and MATE which are both similarly fast and light desktop environments.\nIt comes with the traditional desktop experience, so it would work great for users who came from Windows. It is very customizable and there are a lot of themes to choose from.\n\n4. Elementary OS\n\nPros\n\nVery simple to use\nIt looks beautiful and minimal\nSupportive app store to indie developers\n\nCons\n\nYou cannot choose other DE besides Pantheon\n\nElementary OS is yet another Ubuntu-based distro, but the difference is that it comes with its own desktop environment, Pantheon, and a minimal set of applications. It is arguably macOS-inspired due to its design language, dock, and the system panel on the top.\nTo be honest, it is one of the most beautiful Linux distros and its minimalistic look adds to the beauty. The thing I like the most about Elementary OS is its app store which makes it seamless to help hard-working developers.\n\n3. Pop!_OS\n\nPros\n\nGreat Nvidia support\nBacked by a hardware-selling company\nDisk encryption on by default\n\nCons\n\nDesktop environment choice is limited to GNOME\nNot very good with older hardware with less than 1 GB of RAM\n\nPop!_OS is an Ubuntu-based Linux distro backed by System76. No wonder why they have better Nvidia driver support as the company backing them sells laptops powered by Nvidia.\nIt provides a snappy and polished experience with the help of a slightly-modified GNOME desktop environment. It also comes with an auto-tiling extension which could be handy for power users.\n\n2. Ubuntu\n\nPros\n\nGreat out-of-the-box experience\nBacked by a company\nMany desktop environments to choose from\nGreat community support\n\nCons\n\nGNOME DE could be heavy with older hardware\n\nUbuntu is a Debian-based Linux distro that is backed by Canonical. It comes with GNOME as the default desktop environment, but it comes with others to choose from like Kubuntu (KDE), Lubuntu (LXQt), Ubuntu Mate, UbuntuDDE (Deepin), and many more.\nIt is simple and easy to operate once you get used to it. Community support is also one of its selling points due to its popularity. It also offers many useful preinstalled applications that could give you a head start.\n\nHonorable Mentions\n\nOpenSUSE\nIt is a distro that is sponsored by a German company, SUSE. You can choose a rolling or stable release. It might not focus on simplicity, but it offers the user great flexibility.\n\nDeepin\nIt is a Debian-based distro that comes with its own desktop environment and set of applications. Not only that, but it is subjectively one of the best-looking distros aside from Elementary.\n\nManjaro\nThis is an Arch-based distro. It is like Arch, but it is already configured out-of-the-box without having to manually install the operating system.\n\nKDE Neon\nThis is a Linux distro based on Ubuntu LTS versions. It comes with the latest and greatest KDE packages. KDE Plasma, I would say, is the most customizable desktop environment. It has great support with theme engines like Kvantum.\n\nDebian\nIt is one of the oldest and most stable Linux distros out there. However, for developers, the packages in the repository may be out-of-date.\n\n\n1. Fedora\n\nPros\n\nGreat open-source approach\nVanilla GNOME experience\nBacked by Red Hat\nVery polished experience\n\nCons\n\nSoftware options might be limited\n\nFedora is subjectively the best Linux distro of all time. Like Ubuntu, you are not limited to the GNOME desktop environment due to the variety of officially supported spins. It also comes with strictly FOSS-only preinstalled apps, which might limit your software choice if you do not add additional repositories.\nIt is great for laptops because they are packed with additional optimizations for better battery life. Furthermore, it is also easier to update the system as its application and system updates are handled within the same application, unlike Ubuntu.\n\nConclusion\nThere is really no best Linux distro. All distros have their purposes that will serve a specific person. No one can tell you what is the best Linux distro. This is just a guide to help you consider a distro that will work best for you. Why not fire up that VM and you can decide for yourself?\n\nIf you have opinions on the list, feel free to comment below.

It is designed to be a simple and intuitive tool for creating and editing graphs, with a focus on the user experience.\n\n\nAs mentioned above, Delineate, previously named Dagger, is a new app to view and edit DOT graphs. It is like KGraphViewer, but with the ability to edit the graph and is built with LibAdwaita, which makes it more at home on GNOME. There is also another app called GraphUI, but it is currently unmaintained and designed for Elementary OS.\n\nFeatures\nOne of the main reasons I developed Delineate is for debugging GStreamer pipeline dumps. I use it extensively to visualize the pipeline, inspect the elements, and analyze the negotiations between them.\n\nIt is also useful for visualizing connections on the message bus, offering an alternative perspective to tools like Bustle.\n\nAnother use case I discovered from Bilal is visualizing the Pipewire graph from the pw-dot command.\n\nThe app also supports changing the layout engine on the fly, which is useful for tweaking the graph to make it more readable depending on the use case.\n\nAlso, thanks to the library behind the app, d3-graphviz, it supports animations, which can be less jarring when modifying the graph.\n\nFinally, you can export the graph to a PNG, SVG, or JPG image.\n\n\nGetting Delineate\nDelineate is available on Flathub.

It wasn’t groundbreaking like a full-blown multi-featured DC power supply, but it was a fulfilling learning experience.\nSpoiler alert: mistakes were made, lessons were learned, and yes, we had fun.\n\nDesign and Calculations\nIt began with brainstorming and sketching out ideas. This was our chance to put all the knowledge from our lectures to the test, from diode operating regions to voltage regulation. It was exciting but also a bit daunting.\nThe first decision was our power supply's specifications. We aimed for a 12V output, a solid middle ground between complexity and functionality. Plus, the 5V option was already claimed by another group. For rectification, we chose a full-wave bridge rectifier due to its efficiency compared to the half-wave alternative.\nCalculations? Oh yes, there were plenty! Every components had to line up on paper before moving to reality.\nWe started at the output, aiming for a stable 12V. To achieve this, we selected the LM7812 voltage regulator. It was an obvious choice: simple, reliable, and readily available. With an input range of 14.5 to 27V, it could easily provide the 12V we needed.\nSince the LM7812 can handle a maximum input voltage of 27V, a 12-0-12V transformer would be perfect. However, only a 6-0-6V transformer was available, so we had to make do with that. Regarding with the diode, we used 1N4007 diodes as it is readily available and can handle our desired specifications.\nAssuming the provided input voltage for the regulator is 15.5V, which is also the output of the rectifier $ V_{\\text{p(rec)}} $, the output voltage of the secondary side of the transformer $ V_{\\text{p(sec)}} $ must be:\n$$ V_{\\text{p(sec)}} = V_{\\text{p(rec)}} + 1.4V = 15.5V + 1.4V = 16.9V_{\\text{pk}} $$\nNote: The 1.4V was to account for the voltage drop across the diodes.\nor in RMS,\n$$ \\frac{16.9V_{\\text{pk}}}{\\sqrt{2}} = 11.95V_{\\text{rms}} $$\nThis is perfect four our 6-0-6V transformer maximum output voltage of 12V in RMS.\nUsing the formula for ripple factor,\n$$ r = \\frac{V_{\\text{r(pp)}}}{V_{\\text{dc}}} $$\n$$ V_{\\text{r(pp)}} = r \\times V_{\\text{dc}} $$\nwe can determine the value of the filter capacitor, given a ripple factor $ r $ of 3% or 0.03, and output DC voltage $ V_{\\text{dc}} $ of 12V.\n$$ V_{\\text{r(pp)}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{p(rect)}}}{f \\times R_\\text{L} \\times C} $$\n$$ C = \\frac{V_{\\text{p(rect)}}}{f \\times R_\\text{L} \\times V_{\\text{r(pp)}}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{p(rect)}}}{f \\times R_\\text{L} \\times r \\times V_{\\text{dc}}} $$\nWe also know that a typical frequency of the AC input is 60Hz and we have to multiply it by 2 to get the frequency of the full-wave rectified output.\n$$ f = 2 \\times 60Hz = 120Hz $$\nAlso, given the maximum load current of 50mA, we can calculate the assumed load resistance.\n$$ R_{\\text{L}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{dc}}}{I_{\\text{L}}} = \\frac{12V}{50mA} = 240\\Omega $$\nSubstituting the values,\n$$ C = \\frac{15.5V}{120Hz \\times 240\\Omega \\times 0.03 \\times 12V} = 1495 \\mu F \\approx 1.5 mF $$\nHere is the final schematic diagram of our design based on the calculations:\n\n\nConstruction\nMoving on, we had to put our design into action. This was where the real fun began. We had to source the components, breadboard the circuit, design the PCB, and 3D-print the enclosure.\n\nBreadboarding\nThe breadboarding phase was a mix of excitement and confusion. We had to double-check every connection and component.\n\n\nIt was a tedious process, but the feeling when the 12V LED lit up? Priceless.\n\n\nPCB Design, Etching and Soldering\nFor the PCB design, we used EasyEDA. It was our first time using it, but it was surprisingly intuitive. We just had first to recreate the schematic diagram, then layout the components and traces.\n\nTracing the components on the PCB was a bit tricky, but we managed to get it done. It is like playing connect-the-dots, except no overlapping lines are allowed since we only had a single-layer PCB.\n\nAt the end, it was satisfying to see the final design.\n\nWe had to print it on a sticker paper, transfer it to the copper board, cut it, drill it, etch it, and solder the components.\n\nDid we also mention that we soldered the regulator in reverse for the first time? Oops.\n\nCustom Enclosure\nTo make our project stand out, we decided to 3D-print a custom enclosure. Designing it on SketchUp was surprisingly fun.\n\nIt was also satisfying to see the once a software model come to life as a physical object.\n\n\nTesting\nTesting day was a rollercoaster. Smoke-free? Check. Output voltage stable? Mostly.\n\nLine Regulation Via Varying Input Voltage\nFor the first table, we vary the input voltage, and we measured the input voltage, the transformer output, the filter output, the regulator output, and the percent voltage regulation.\nTrial No.Input Voltage ($ V_{\\text{rms}} $)Transformer Output ($ V_{\\text{rms}} $)Filter Output ($ V_{\\text{DC}} $)Regulator Output ($ V_{\\text{DC}} $)% Voltage Regulation\n121312.113.5811.975\n221411.213.8211.925\n321510.713.7312.0310\n421611.513.8011.9310\n521710.813.2612.019\n621811.013.5911.929\n722011.313.7411.922\n822212.513.6111.962\n922412.313.5711.9310\n1022611.913.8811.9410\nAverage-11.5313.6711.9535.5\n\nNote: The load resistor is a 22Ω resistor.\n\n\nLoad Regulation Via Varying Load Resistance\nFor the second table, we vary the load resistance, and we measured the input voltage, the transformer output, the filter output, the regulator output, and the percent voltage regulation.\nTrial No.Load Resistance ($ \\Omega $)Transformer Output ($ V_{\\text{rms}} $)Filter Output ($ V_{\\text{DC}} $)Regulator Output ($ V_{\\text{FL(DC)}} $)% Voltage Regulation\n122010.611.9610.2216.4385\n250010.712.8311.434.1120\n31k11.113.0511.463.8394\n42k11.113.0611.483.6585\n55k10.613.2011.493.5683\n66k10.913.2611.781.0187\n710k11.213.3911.850.4219\n811k11.313.9111.870.2527\n920k11.313.5311.890.0841\n1022k11.113.2711.900\nAverage-10.9913.1511.543.3394\n\nNote: The primary voltage applied to the transformer was 220V in RMS. The $ V_{\\text{NL(DC)}} $ used in computing the % voltage regulation is 11.9 V.\n\n\nData Interpretation\nLooking at the tables, the LM7812 did a great job keeping the output mostly steady at 12V, even when we threw in some wild input voltage swings. That said, when the load resistance became too low, it struggled a bit, showing the limits of our trusty (but modest) 6-0-6V transformer. On the other hand, our filtering capacitors kept the ripples under control and gave us a smooth DC output.\n\nClosing Words\nThis DC power supply project was a fantastic learning experience; it brought classroom concepts to life and gave us hands-on insight into circuit design and testing. While it performed well for what it is, it’s important to note that this design isn’t meant for serious, high-stakes applications. Think of it more as a stepping stone than a professional-grade project.\nOverall, we learned a lot about troubleshooting, design limitations, and real-world performance. With a bit more fine-tuning, this could even inspire more advanced builds down the line. For now, it’s a win for learning and the satisfaction of making something work (mostly) as planned!\nSpecial thanks to our professor for guiding us and to my amazing groupmates—Roneline, Rhaniel, Peejay, Aaron, and Rohn—for making this experience enjoyable and productive (ask them?).\nIf you have any questions or feedback, feel free to leave a comment below.

This summer, I will be working on the Rust and GTK 4 rewrite of Bustle, a D-Bus activity visualizer, with the guidance of my mentors, Bilal Elmoussaoui and Maximiliano Sandoval.\n\nMe and my bizarre open-source journey\nWeirdly enough, I first discovered Linux five years ago on a failed attempt to do Hackintosh. I got bored with Windows that I decided to try something new and different, and that's when I eventually stumbled upon Linux, specifically Elementary OS. It did not last for me since I still depend a lot on applications that are only available with Windows.\nFast-forward two years later, I decided to give Linux another try with KDE Neon and migrate my workflows to open-source applications such as LibreOffice, Inkscape, and Kdenlive. I remember feeling adventurous and breaking my system numerous times, though I considered it as part of the learning process. I was intrigued by the idea of being a part of a community of passionate developers and enthusiastic users. I also liked the customization it had. However, as I grew with it, I started to realize that I had spent way too much time configuring things and forgetting to focus on what was really important, and that is when I discovered GNOME.\nWhen I first used GNOME, it was a totally different workflow, and I liked it. It was simple; the UI made sense. At that time, there was some software I was missing, particularly a screen recording application that works nicely on Wayland. That was the time I discovered RecApp. It worked well; however, it looked not at home, even for a GTK application. One of my first contributions was creating a mockup for the redesign, and I also took that opportunity to learn Python and GTK and implement my mockup. I was not necessarily proud of my code, but I was proud and happy about having the chance to contribute to the software I use and the community.\nA few months later, as I learned more about programming and the GNOME developer ecosystem, there were many more things I'd like to improve and change in RecApp, some of which other contributors did not agree with. That's when Kooha was born, with a total in-and-out redesign of RecApp and a different focus and ideology. Almost a month later was also the birth of Mousai, a song recognizer application. Since then, I have been maintaining these two applications.\nThere are definitely a lot of things I missed, but that was a quick summary of my journey with open-source.\n\nMore about Bustle and the project\nFor those who have not heard of Bustle, it is an application used to visualize D-Bus activities. It shows signal emissions, method calls, method returns, and errors, which are useful in observing traffic, debugging, and optimizing performance in D-Bus applications.\n\nAlthough the current implementation of Bustle in Haskell and GTK 3 is functional, there are noteworthy reasons to consider a rewrite in Rust. Some of these advantages include having access to a range of libraries, such as zbus, gtk4-rs, and LibPCAP bindings. Aside from this, the growing Rust community and the availability of the Rust SDK in Flathub would make the tool more accessible to contributors and simpler to distribute to the users. On the other hand, porting Bustle to GTK 4 would over benefits such as the newer and more modern LibAdwaita widgets and ListView API, which would make it easier for the tool to comply with the HIG and benefit from the latest developments in the platform.\nAltogether, this rewrite and port will contribute to the maintainability, accessibility, and future-proofing of Bustle through the use of newer technologies and arguably more ergonomic technologies.\n\nI will be posting updates about the project every few weeks for the next few months, including more details about the plans for this GSoC project. If you'd like to talk about something, feel free to contact me at Matrix @sedve:matrix.org.\nThanks for reading!\n","id":"https://seadve.github.io/blog/3-gsoc-2023-introduction/","title":"GSoC 2023: Rust and GTK 4 Bustle Rewrite (Introduction)"},"https://seadve.github.io/blog/4-gsoc-2023-week-1-2/":{"body":"\nProgress Made\nBefore the GSoC coding period started, I started implementing the diagram used to display DBus activity with the help of the template repository made by my mentor, Maximiliano. One of the first challenges is figuring out how to load the PCAP files, which is the format Bustle uses to store the DBus messages. Without implementing that first, it would be difficult to test how the diagram will look like.\n\nThe Rust PCAP library was used to load the packets from the PCAP file, which contains the bytes of a DBus Message. It is nice to use, though it is missing an async API for loading files. That could be fixed in the future, but this week mainly focused on a basic diagram implementation. The bytes can then be parsed through GDBus into a GDBusMessage, which contains the information to implement the diagram.\nThrough the parsed message, the diagram can be implemented. It uses GtkListView to display the rows as, aside from having a nice separation of view and model, it is more efficient because it recycles widgets, especially since PCAP files could possibly contain thousands of messages. Each row contains the elapsed time, path, destination, interface, and member of the message.\n\nAside from the diagram, a DetailsView was also implemented. It shows the sender and the body, and also the destination, path, and member of the message. For more information about it, you can check out the merge request.\n\nGDBus was used initially as zbus is missing the necessary APIs for parsing messages from bytes. However, the merge requests are already on the way to implement those upstream, including a nicer way to print zbus::Value that would match how GVariants are printed.\n\nzv: impl Display for Value, Array, Structure, Dict &amp; Maybe\nzb: Add a from_bytes constructor for Message\n\n\nPlans for the Following Weeks\nWhile the merge requests are in place, there is still some work to do, such as fixing up the Display implementation for zbus::Value::Str and zbus::Value::Array. Once the mentioned merge requests are merged, we could finish up the zbus port.\nAfter the application is fully ported to zbus, we could start working on the more complicated part of the Diagram implementation, like showing signals and the method call and return arrows.\n\nThat's all for this week.

However, while preparing for the finals, we got the PR to add from_bytes constructor for zbus::Message merged.

With this blocker cleared out, the zbus port MR has also been merged, fully porting the Bustle rewrite to zbus.\n\nFurthermore, my mentor, Bilal, started implementing session monitoring and saving to a PCAP file while I continued their work and implemented system and address recording. However, it is not yet merged as there are some things to be figured out and more work to do. Specifically, it currently requires a dbus-monitor binary installed on the host, which is not great for distributions that do not package it.\n\nAside from those mentioned above, I have also been working on drawing the diagram. I am still studying the older Haskell codebase to prevent reinventing the wheel on some implementations. Unfortunately, the current implementation is still not ready enough for a screenshot.\nTo easily track the missing features, we also set up an issue board.\n\nPlans for the Following Weeks\nIn the following weeks, I will get the PR to implement and address recording merged and work on more parts of the diagram drawing.\n\nThat's all for this week.

First, the MR to add address and system DBus recording has already been merged. Though, before that was merged, a few revisions have been made: it now parses from messages bytes directly, instead of a PCAP stream, to prevent overhead. Additionally, it now properly propagates errors, such as when the dbus-monitor binary is not found.\n\nSecond, when recording, the sequence diagram now sticks at the bottom because, in common use cases, it is mostly wanted to observe the new messages as they come.\n\nMoreover, on the smaller changes, PCAP file loading is now synchronous, the gtk4-rs dependency has now been updated to the recently released 0.17 version, the accuracy of timestamp calculations has been improved, and the focus issue on the address dialog has been fixed.\nLastly, the signals and method call arrows and arcs are now (finally!) drawn in the diagram. While it looks simple, it took me days to get it right. However, there is no merge request yet since it requires more bug fixing and code cleanup.\n\n\nGUADEC\nAside from working on the code, I also attended GUADEC remotely. I had a lightning talk about a bit about myself and an overview of this project.\n\nPlans for the Following Weeks\nFor the next weeks, the diagram still needs bug fixing and polishing, as mentioned. For instance, it currently does not draw arcs on method calls when either the call or return row is not visible. The header is also only visible when scrolled all the way to the top, and it only shows the unique name instead of the well-known name.\nAfter the diagram is completed, we will go on with the implementation of service filtering and adding a more convenient way to have multiple instances of recording or opened files via tabs.\n\nThat's all for this week.

Starting with the most important thing, the diagram, a lot of bugs has been squashed and the rendering performance is now improved to a usable and merge-able state.\n\n\nAside from that, it now has a header that doesn't overlay on the diagram, the drawings now properly adjust to text scale factor changes, the signal arrows are now drawn, and the rows are no longer clipped into the row titles.\nMy mentor, Bilal, also worked on adding tags, the colored circles in the diagram, so it is easier to determine the category of a message.\nOn the general UI side, there is now a proper loading page that is shown while waiting for the PCAP files to show.\n\nHowever, that may not be as useful as we also landed a patch that speeds up loading by up to 32 times; that's from 16 seconds on average to 500 milliseconds, when loading a 2.2 MB file.\nThere is also now a waiting page that shows before the first message arrives while recording.\n\nWe also landed statistics window which shows frequencies of messages, durations of method calls, and sizes information of each message.\n\n\n\nMy mentor, Bilal, also worked on adding information on the details view including the body size and signature, and the response time from method return to its call.\n\nThere is also now a way to save the PCAP file as a DOT graph file, which can be used to generate a graph using Graphviz to visualize interactions between bus names like the following:\n\nOn the plumbing side, saving to PCAP file is now asynchronous, avoiding blocking the UI. We also ported from using libpcap to a pure Rust library, removing unsafe code and simplifying the codebase. Furthermore, the timestamp computation is now more accurate.\nAs part of making debugging in Bustle easier, I have also submitted a patch to zbus to simplify the printing of bus names.\nFinally, I started prototyping services filtering. It is still a proof of concept and does not look great, but it already functions and is a good starting point for next week.\n\n\nPlans for the Following Weeks\nThe following weeks will be the last days of GSoC and I will be focusing on finishing up the remaining tasks. With the most difficult part of this GSoC project done, most of the tasks left, aside from services filtering, are optimizing performance and cleaning up the codebase.\nThere are also a few more things to fix such as a proper name owner changed signal handling, drawing method call arc regardless if the row is not drawable, properly killing the dbus-monitor process, and propagating user-facing errors.\nI would also like to add features such as adding a button that scroll to the method call message of a method return message or vice-versa, porting to use the new GskPath APIs, and adding a way to open multiple diagrams at once via tabs and multiple windows.\n\nThat's all for this week.

This post is an overview of the work done and the future plans for the project.\n\nAbout Bustle\nBustle is a graphical application used to analyze D-Bus activities. It uses sequence diagrams to present signal emissions and method calls messages.\n\nBustle represents these messages using a row-based layout. Each row is dedicated to displaying the following information: the elapsed time since the first message, the message path, and the member, which could be the name of the emitted signal or invoked method. On the other hand, individual columns correspond to distinct D-Bus services. Bustle draws arrows that transverse these columns to visualize the communication between services, while arcs represent method invocations and returns. This visual paradigm is valuable as, for instance, it can be used to see which services a D-Bus application talks to and how often, which can be handy in debugging, enhancing security, and optimizing performance within the application.\n\nProject Goal\nThe ultimate goal of this project is to port Bustle to GTK 4 and rewrite it in Rust. Although the current implementation of Bustle in Haskell and GTK 3 is functional, there are compelling reasons to consider a rewrite in Rust. This includes enabling the tool to take advantage of a range of ergonomic libraries, including zbus, gtk4-rs, and pcap-file, that would ease the burden in maintenance. Furthermore, the growing Rust community and the availability of the Rust SDK in Flathub would make the tool more accessible to potential contributors and simpler to distribute to users.\nPorting the tool to GTK 4, on the other hand, would offer several benefits, such as access to newer and more performant widgets and drawing APIs like GtkListView and GskPath. This would allow Bustle to benefit from the latest developments in the platform and remain current with evolving standards.\nAltogether, a rewrite of Bustle in Rust and GTK 4 would provide advantages that can enhance the tool's functionality, maintainability, longevity, accessibility, and possibly efficiency.\n\nWork Done\nMost of the tasks in the original proposal have been completed. This includes having an initial MVP, porting GDBus usage to zbus, implementing file loading and saving, completing the recording functionality, and porting the UI, which comprises the diagram, details view, and services filter, to GTK 4.\nFor more details on the work done, there are also bi-weekly updates on my blog.\n\nSnapshots\n\nDiagram and Details View\n\n\nRecording and Services Filter\n\n\nCode Merged\nThese are the summary of code that has been merged during the GSoC period.\n\nBustle\nMost of the work done is in the Bustle GNOME GitLab repository, where the following pull requests have been merged:\n\nBasic parsing and diagram implementation\nPort to zbus\nDrop explicit cargo protocol setting\nDecouple recording monitor from DiagramModel\nImplement system and address monitoring and recording\nLoad DiagramModel from file asynchronously\nStick at the bottom when an item is added to the diagram\nBump gtk4-rs version\nImprove timestamp accuracy\nFocus on the entry row when dialog presents\nSave DiagramModel to file asynchronously\nFurther improve timestamp accuracy\nHandle undefined behavior\nEnable link-time optimization and various cleanups\nAdd loading and waiting pages on the window\nShow a toast when clicking copy and other fixes\nImplement diagram columns, arrows, and arcs\nImprove loading performance and code organization\nImplement API to get well-known names from bus names\nRefactor name owner changed signal handling\nOrganize diagram files\nImprove file naming\nMonitor code cleanups\nAdd support for targeted signals\nPort from libpcap to pcap-file\nUse a more proper column width\nImproving diagram tag styling\nProperly update the color and label of RowTag\nImproving diagram styling\nPropagate errors to the user\nOnly show errors when necessary\nPrevent copy when packet data is owned\nFix DiagramHeader labels UI glitch\nColorWidget and DiagramView cleanups\n\n\nzbus and gtk4-rs\nWhile the project is focused on Bustle, some changes are necessary to be upstreamed to other projects. This includes changes to zbus and gtk4-rs, where the following pull requests have been merged:\n\nzbus\n\nzb: Add a from_bytes constructor for Message\nzv: Implement Display for Value, Array, Structure, Dict &amp; Maybe\nzv, zn: Improve Str, Owned*Name, BusName Debug implementations\n\n\ngtk4-rs\n\ngdk: Make RGBA::new const and add with_* constructors\n\n\nCode to be Merged\nDue to time constraints and unexpected issues, some of the pull requests are still pending review:\n\nImplement services filter\nPort to GskPath APIs\nMake use of GtkMapListModel for layouts\nImplement BusNameList and FilteredBusNameModel\nFix header expanded height computation\n\n\nFuture Plans\nWhile most of the tasks in the proposal have been completed, there are still a few things that need to be done, including the following:\n\nOptimizing performance\nHunting and squashing bugs:\n\nImproving name owner changed signal handling\nDrawing method call arc regardless if the row is not drawable\nProperly killing the dbus-monitor process\n\n\nAdding more features:\n\nAdding a button that scrolls to the method call message of a method return message or vice-versa\nAdding a way to open multiple diagrams at once via tabs and multiple windows\n\n\nFixing regressions and releasing the application on Flathub\nContinuous involvement and contribution to open-source\n\n\nFinal Words\nI have to say this is, so far, the most challenging part of my software development journey. It felt like a hackathon since I had to understand things and create something that works quickly. While it was challenging, it was also rewarding as I was able to learn a lot of things and create something that I am proud of. There were moments of time pressure and frustration, but with experimentation, collaboration, and a lot of reading, I was able to overcome these challenges and make meaningful progress. The complexity of the project pushed me out of my comfort zone, forcing me to delve into unfamiliar areas of programming and technology.\nLastly, I would like to express my gratitude to my mentors, Bilal Elmoussaoui and Maximiliano Sandoval, for tirelessly reviewing my pull requests and guiding me. I would also like to thank the GNOME Foundation and the community, especially the GNOME GSoC admin, Felipe Borges, for giving me the opportunity to work on this project. I would also like to extend my appreciation to zbus maintainer, Zeeshan Ali Khan, for their help in getting my pull requests merged against zbus and to the original Bustle developer, Will Thompson, for their guidance. Finally, I would like to thank my family and friends for their support and encouragement.\n","id":"https://seadve.github.io/blog/9-gsoc-2023-final-overview/","title":"GSoC 2023: Rust and GTK 4 Bustle Rewrite (Final Overview)"},"https://seadve.github.io/designs/":{"body":"","id":"https://seadve.github.io/designs/","title":"Designs"},"https://seadve.github.io/donate/":{"body":"Buy me a drink, fuel my apps, or simply throw money my way.

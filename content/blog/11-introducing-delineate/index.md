## Introduction

* What is Delineate (brief description of what it does)
* What it solves (why was it created)

## Features

## Getting Delineate

Delineate is available on [Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/io.github.seadve.Delineate). You can install it from there, and since all of our code is open-source and can be freely modified and distributed according to the license, you can also [download](https://github.com/SeaDve/Delineate/releases/tag/v0.1.0) and build it from source.

## Future Plans

## Acknowledgment

I would also like to thank Brage Fuglseth for the name and icon design.
